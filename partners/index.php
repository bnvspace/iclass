<h4>Our partnerships</h4>
 We are proud to have partner educational institutions all over the world. At the same time we do not tend to have as many partners as possible. Our partners are our good friends with whom we plan mutual promotion activities together and are always in touch. We are glad to consider partnership opportunities with any educational institution that is interested in having partner agency in St.Petersburg.<br>
<h4>IClass School of Foreign Languages</h4>
 In 2000 our IClass School of Foreign Languages was established. Since then and till nowadays the agency and the school have been&nbsp;working together in close cooperation. The school specialisation is preparation for international language examinations: IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, GMAT, DELE, TestDaf, DELF, DALF and many others. We understand that any kind of education abroad is impossible without sufficient level of foreign language. For that reason our school is so important in our work.<br>
<h4>Our marketing strategies</h4>
 IClass is a very active and constantly&nbsp;developing agency with impressive marketing policy. Some years ago we started doing our own marketing events with participation of our partners or by ourselves: education fairs, seminars, presentations, open lectures, master classes. Our events are mainly narrow-targeted and devoted to a particular country or educational institution. That allows educators not to spend their precious time for those who are not interested in their offers and focus on prospective students only. At the same time, audience at our events know very well that they will receive necessary information at our events.&nbsp;<br>
 Already for several years we have arranged IClass UKFair (twice a year), IClass Dutch Fair (once or twice a year), American Education Day (each October) and&nbsp;a wide range&nbsp;of presentations of educational institutions, seminars of education opportunities in different countries. Every year we arrange more and more events and are open for any new ideas and initiatives. With IClass our partners can strenghen their presence on Russian market significantly.<br>
 We also regulary print our IClass Catalogue of higher education where our partners are presented.<br>
 The latest version of the catalogue can be found <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4nxpqs2g51mvehl/Higher%20Education%20Catalogue%202015.pdf?dl=0">here</a> If you are interested in being included into the next edition of the catalogue (will be issued by spring 2019), please contact our marketing department (contacts can be found below).<br>
<h4>Specifications of St.Petersburg market</h4>
 St.Petersburg market is unique and has its own peculiarities and features&nbsp;as well as, probably, any other market. It is different in comparison with other regions of Russia, too.&nbsp;Here people who are thinking of studying abroad take it very seriously and need really much time to think about everything very&nbsp;carefully. There are many students who ask for detailed information while they plan to apply in some years only. If a student and family decide to go to an agency, they will visit&nbsp;many different companies before making their final choice.
